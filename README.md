# Blight-Disease-Classification-FullStack

## Full stack Deep Learning Project Using Convolution Neural Network

This project is built for blight disease classification.
Blight diseases, which affect plants, trees, and crops, are caused by various pathogens such as bacteria, fungi, or oomycetes. 
These diseases can have significant effects on agriculture, ecosystems, and even human population.
